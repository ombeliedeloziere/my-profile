      <h2>Fashion</h2>
        <p>Since i was little, I always have had a passion for fashion. It makes me feel unique as i like to express my personality through my clothes and accessories. That is why I am a member of the fashion association of the IESEG.  Moreover, i do sewing as i love to create clothes in my own image. My grandmothers taught me to sew and I remember that when I was a kid I used to love watch them. </p>

      <h2>Cooking</h2>
      <p>At home I was always taught that cooking was truly important and I always ate very well. For me, it is unthinkable to eat tasteless dishes or the same dishes every day. So, as a student, I try to prepare good recipes for myself !</p>

      <h2>handicraft activities</h2>
      <p>As a child, i always wanted to draw and do manual activities such as painting, watercolour, pottery and jewellery making. My mother always enrolled me in drawing classes because i loved it. I still enjoy these activities, even though i have less time to consecrate to them. </p>

      <h2>Films and series about music</h2>
      <p>I don't know why I've always loved movies and series about music so much I can't get enough of them. I love to be entertained by watching a movie while being able to sing in front of it. My favourite movie is "Pitch Perfect" and it is about a group of girls singing a cappella and having singing competitions. I also love the series "Glee" and biopics like "Rocketman" and "Bohemian Rhapsody". </p>
